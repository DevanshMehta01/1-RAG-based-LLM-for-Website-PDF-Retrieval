RAG-LLM: Smart Retrieval from Websites & PDFs

ðŸŒŸ Whatâ€™s this about?
Finding information inside long PDFs or across websites can be time-consuming.
This project tackles that problem by building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
-Takes a website link or an uploaded PDF
-Extracts and indexes the content as embeddings
-Stores knowledge as embeddings and lets a Large Language Model answer your questions conversationally.  
This isnâ€™t just a toy â€” itâ€™s a real-world style app people can imagine being used in knowledge management, document search, or customer support.

âœ¨ Highlights
 1. Scrape any website â†’ instantly index the content
 2. Upload PDFs â†’ parse text and make it searchable
 3. Semantic search with FAISS â†’ finds meaning, not just keywords
 4. Groq-powered Qwen3-32B LLM â†’ answers feel natural, not robotic
 5. Streamlit UI â†’ simple, clean, recruiter-friendly demo
 6. Deployable with Docker / Hugging Face Spaces

ðŸ›  Tech in Action
->LangChain for RAG pipeline
->HuggingFace embeddings + FAISS for vector search
->Groq API (Qwen3-32B) for fast, smart answers
->BeautifulSoup + PyPDF2 for scraping & parsing
->Streamlit for the interactive UI
